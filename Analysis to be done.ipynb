    "# Types of analysis:\n",
    "# 1) Summary of each product (apples or aubergines), grouped by country of origin\n",
    "# 1b) under each Country group, results grouped by detected chemicals (DC)\n",
    "# 1c) for each DC, show the count of products with some detected and the range they were in\n",
    "# 1d) for each DC, show the count of products with none-detected\n",
    "# 2) Counts of product items grouped by country of origin, e.g \"Apples from USA = 6, Apples from France = 3 \"\n",
    "# 3) Distribution of DCs grouped by country of origin, e.g. boscalid : UK = 2, USA = 5.\n",
    "# 4) Statement of Count Range of DCs found in how many of total number of samples, e.g. \"Residues (ranging from 1 to 11) were detected in 12 of 24 of the samples analysed\"\n",
    "# 5) A table showing number of residues, sample ID, Type of apple, amounts of each DC (and a '-' if n/a) and the country of origin\n",
    "# 6) total list of chemicals analysed for but not found.\n",
    "# ideas:\n",
    "# 1) for each product, show pie chart of prods with none detected, one detected, multiple detected\n",
    "# 2) same as above, but filter by supermarket.\n",
    "# 2b) same as above but filter by country of origin\n",
    "# 2c) same as above but show breakdown\n",
    "# 3) scattergraph of amounts detected across product category, compared to MRLs (either individual DCs or agregated)\n",
    "# 4) Stacked bargraph showing total amount detected per sample, with a different colour to represent each DC.\n",
    "# 5) some kind of graph to represent the chemicals that were not detected"
